## 2. Summary of Baseline State
- **Core Strengths**: True Resilience4j FSM, Normalized Protocol IR, strict fail-closed tool schema validation (Rule 3), non-poisoning failure taxonomy, zero URL key leaks, zero global socket mutations, 51/51 unit tests passing.
- **Architectural Gaps to Reach Master Mandate (V3)**:
  1. Router must consume real observed telemetry rather than hardcoded 200ms latency.
  2. Implement `ToolExecutionLedger` for idempotency and ambiguous failure detection.
  3. Implement explicit `FailoverPlan` for semantic failover observability.
  4. Implement structured context extraction for tool outputs rather than blind head/tail character slicing.
  5. Expand benchmark suite to full B1–B15 scenarios with 6 fair baselines (A through F).
  6. Build primary research benchmark in `benchmarks/semantic_failover/`.
  7. Implement structured JSON observability with credential redaction.
  8. Implement deterministic local demo `python -m llm_circuit_breaker.demo`.
  9. Add security hardening against SSRF, request/response size bombs, and malicious tool schemas.
  10. Conduct forced high-concurrency load testing (100+ simultaneous operations).
