## Phase 0: Baseline Audit & Work Plan
- **Date:** 2026-09-03
- **Commit:** `v2-01-baseline`
- **Objective:** Perform repository-wide audit, execute initial test suite, identify architecture gaps and defects, create `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BASELINE.md` and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- **Files Created/Modified:**
  - `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BASELINE.md`
  - `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
  - `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`
- **Tests Run:**
  - `uv run pytest -v` (14 passed in 0.83s)
- **Results:** Clean baseline established. Identified key defects: lack of formal circuit breaker state machine, global socket timeout mutation, credentials in URLs, and heuristic argument guessing.
- **Known Limitations:** Prototype lacks formal circuit breaker, capability routing, protocol IR, tool schema validator, and fault injection.
- **Next Phase:** Phase 1 (Core Domain Models & Failure Taxonomy) and Phase 2 (Formal Circuit Breaker).
